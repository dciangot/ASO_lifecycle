* Changes in 1_1_0

 Now following the convention that this ChangeLog tracks only the first two
 digits of the version number, allowing the last one to cycle freely with
 bugfixes and trivial changes that need not be documented.

 * remove BETA declaration. The site is still not complete, but the
   functionality is robust enough to come out of beta
 * add phedex-nextgen-* modules to take on the gradual replacement of the
   existing old website

 * Changes in BETA_1_0_2 (BETA_1_0_1 was never released)
   * fixed numerous small bugs
   * code now satisfies stricter coding standard (using the 'closure-compiler')
   * showing JSON data no longer considered beta
   * add new shift-requestedqueued module for showing details about transfer queues to sites
   * improved cacheability and allow compression of components
   * some cosmetic improvements, such as to the login component

 * Changes in BETA_1_0_0
   * fixed bug in datatable views where nested datatable contents were not
     correctly filtered
   * Added support for flagging features as 'alpha' or 'beta' (or anything
     else, for that matter) in context-menus and in the navigator
 * Changes in BETA_0_9
   * APPSERV renamed to WEBAPP, with minor consequences everywhere. No visible
     change for the user, however.
   * More examples added, including several low-level uses of the core
     components (loader, logger, datasvc...)
  * New modules:
   * protovisdemo, a demonstration of using the protovis charting tool in the
     PhEDEx webapp structure (alpha-release)
   * shift-requestedqueued, a module custom-made for shifters to help them
     monitor things rapidly. (alpha-release)
 * Changes in BETA_0_8
   * Several new modules added in this release, following the plan from the link shown below.
   * Many modules can now take wildcarded names, for nodes or groups. Simply type the string you want instead of allowing the auto-complete to do it for you.
   * Some of these modules can take either a node or a group name as input, this represents a new level of navigational complexity
   * There are two versions of the 'pending-requests' module (see https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/index.php?63182 as well as the PhEDEx web planning), to provide some choice to *Ops.
   * Modules that require a 'time-since' parameter have that parameter rounded to the nearest minute (or whatever multiple thereof makes most sense).
   * The new modules are:
      phedex-module-consistencyresults.js
      phedex-module-custodiallocation.js
      phedex-module-pendingrequests.js
      phedex-module-pendingrequestsnested.js
      phedex-module-unroutabledata.js
   * The website coding examples have been included under the 'Explore by Information' category.
   * There are no major known issues in this release

 * Changes in BETA_0_3

   * This is the (first) Spring 2010 beta release. See https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PhedexProjWebsite#Plan_for_the_Spring_2010_Beta for more information
   * Re-write using new architecture.
   * Several new modules added. The set for this release is:
      phedex-module-agentlogs.js
      phedex-module-agents.js
      phedex-module-blocklocation.js
      phedex-module-groupusage.js
      phedex-module-linkview.js
      phedex-module-missingfiles.js
      phedex-module-nodes.js
      phedex-module-queuedmigrations.js
      phedex-module-static.js
   * Known features. I.e. inconsistencies, incompleteness, or other things we do not consider to be bugs
      * Some context-menu possibilities are missing. E.g, in the 'missingfiles' module, node-names appear, but there is no context-menu option to navigate to their agents or links views etc
      * The 'blocklocation' module is not like the rest. It does not have a context menu or a filter, for example
      * The 'global filter' input box does not do anything if you edit it. At the moment, it simply reflects the status of the current module-filter, so is not truly a global filter at all
      * The filter-state does not appear in the permalinks or the browser history. Although it can be set from a permalink, you would have to construct that permalink by hand, yourself.

 * Changes in BETA_0_2

   * Improvements to the navigator global filter, including filter
     field help text and collapsable sections in filter form.

 * Version BETA_0_1

 First release including:

   * Navigator: an application navigation component.  This component
     sits at the top of the page and allows the user to selcect the
     "target type" (context, e.g. node), the "target value"
     (e.g. T0_CH_CERN_Export) and the widget (e.g. Links).  A global
     filter maintains filter state between widgets and provides a
     syntax for filter options to be applied to widgets.
   * Nodes widget: shows a list of nodes and associated properties in
     a sortable table.
   * Agents widget: shows a list of agents and associated properties
     in a sortable table
   * LinkView widget: shows the incoming/outgoing transfers for a
     given node, including the recent transfer statistics (rate,
     errors, quality) and the number of files currently in queue.  The
     user may drill-down into a link to see the currently queued
     blocks and files.
   * Context-Menu based navigation and operation.  Users can right-
     click on elements to navigate to another view of that element
     (e.g., see the agents running from some node clicked on) or issue
     commands to the widget (e.g. sort by that data field)

 This release is for early evaluation of the application and is
 intended to demonstrate the framework for which further widgets will
 be built upon.  The widgets provided are intended to be functional
 for their purpose, but by no means are all requirements of this
 application met in this release.
