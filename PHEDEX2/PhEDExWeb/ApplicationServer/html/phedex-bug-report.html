<h1>So you think you've found a bug...?</h1>
<p>Before reporting a bug, please read these guidelines, and make sure you provide the maximum amount of information that you can.</p>
<div style='clear:both'></div>

<h2>Check your browser version</h2>
<p>We only support the latest version of firefox for development of the beta series. Later, when we go to production, we will support Safari, and possibly other browsers, as requested. The first thing to check is if the problem is visible with the latest firefox version or not.

<h2>Is the problem data-related?</h2>
<p>If you suspect a bug in the algorithm used in one of the data-modules, you can take a snapshot of the JSON data-structure to include in the bug-report. Simply right-click on the content-area of the module and select <strong>'Show table/treeview data (JSON)'</strong>. This will create a pop-up window which contains the data. Cut-and-paste this into your bug-report.</p>

<h2>Can you get a screen-shot?</h2>
<p>If you can get a screen-shot, please do. Especially if your report concerns the visual layout of information.</p>

<h2>Is the problem reproducible?</h2>
<p>Spend some time trying to understand if the problem is reproducible. Non-reproducible errors are extremely hard to debug, obviously! Does it happen only if you navigate a certain path (load page, select module, set filter?) or does it happen if you save a bookmark to the current page and reload it?</p>

<h2>How widespread is the problem?</h2>
<p>Does the problem apply to all modules of the same type (all treeviews or all datatables?)? Does it depend on the sorting or filtering options?</p>

<h2>Note the date and time</h2>
<p>We may need to check server-logs to see if that contributed to your problem</p>

<h2>Record the URL</h2>
<p>The next-gen webapp uses the browser history to maintain a significant amount of state-information about the page you are viewing (the module, its arguments, and any sort and filter options you have set). You can cut-and-paste the URL from either the browser address-bar or from the <span class='phedex-link phedex-link-inline'>Link</span> button on the page to get the current page-state. Include this in your report.</p>

<h2>Has the bug been reported before?</h2>
<p>Check to see if someone else has reported the same problem before reporting it yourself. <a href='https://github.com/dmwm/PHEDEX/issues' target='browse_bugs' title='Browse PhEDEx next-gen website bug reports'>If it has been reported already</a>, see if you can add anything to the ticket that might help in the diagnosis</p>

<h2>Report the bug!</h2>
<p>Once you've got all that information, go ahead and <a target='new_bugs' title='PhEDEx Issues bug-reporting and feature requests' href='https://github.com/dmwm/PHEDEX/issues/new'>report this bug</a></p>
