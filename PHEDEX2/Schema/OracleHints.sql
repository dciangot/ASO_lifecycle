I have enabled the feature allowing you to manage access privileges to
your data with password-protected roles for 3 CMS Transfer Management
accounts on CMSSG. What you should do in order to implement your data
access policy is the following:
- as CMS_TRANSFERMGMT user create appropriate roles with command:
    CREATE ROLE role_name IDENTIFIED BY some_password;
- Grant all desired object privileges to those roles:
    GRANT privilege_name ON object_name TO role_name;
- Grant roles to CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_READER and/or CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_WRITER
  accounts:
    GRANT role_name to CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_READER | CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_WRITER
- Change your application in a way that after connection to
  CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_READER or CMS_TRANSFERMGMT_WRITER account it enables
  one of the created roles (I guess that it doesn't matter too much that
  it is not possible to use bind variables in this case as long as the
  query below is not executed too often):
    SET ROLE role_name IDENTIFIED BY some_password, DESIGNER;

Role DESIGNER is a role that all your account have by default so probably
it is reasonable to keep this role active.  */

Q: Dump a database schema *in sql format* (i.e. something we can feed
to sqlplus later, or compare with our own *.sql files)?

A: Unfortunately this task in Oracle in not trivial and there is no
single command/tool that exports all schema objects in form of DDL
statements. However there is DBMS_METADATA PL/SQL package that helps
to perform such export. Please refer Oracle documentation:

http://oracle-documentation.web.cern.ch/oracle-documentation/ora9ir2/appdev.920/a96612/d_metada.htm#1656

I am not sure but it is possible that Oracle Designer provides
functionality you need.

You can also use some non-Oracle reverse engineering tools like this
offered at http://www.keeptool.com. Although this software is commercial
there should be 30-day, full functional version, available.

Q: Dump a database and reload into another database?

A: This task is easy only if you want to move data from one Oracle
database to another Oracle database. For this purpose you should use
DataPump export/import tools on Oracle10g
http://oracle-documentation.web.cern.ch/oracle-documentation/10gdoc/server.101/b10825/toc.htm

or legacy export/import tools in case of Oracle9i
http://oracle-documentation.web.cern.ch/oracle-documentation/ora9ir2/server.920/a96652/toc.htm
