-- create new latency tables

@PHEDEX_CVS/Schema/OracleCoreLatency

-- fill old latency table into new table
-- NOTE: the BlockLatency SQL was not updating files/bytes counts for blocks that were still open when the transfer started,
-- NOTE: therefore the number of files/bytes transferred in the block is systematically underestimated in this case.
-- NOTE: For this reason, we increase the files/bytes count if we notice that more files were injected into the block after
-- NOTE: the creation of the entry in the latency table. This might not be the actual number of files that were transferred
-- NOTE: in the block at the time, if the block was updated after closure (invalidating some files, or reopening and injecting more files),
-- NOTE: but it is correct or closer to the correct value in most cases
-- NOTE2: for block_close (the block closure time), for incomplete blocks our only estimate is the last block time_update, assuming that the block wasn't
-- NOTE2: updated again after closure (invalidating some files, or reopening and injecting more files). We still use this estimate, because
-- NOTE2: the block_close time isn't used in the latency calculation (it's only logged to find out how much time passed AFTER the transfer of the last replica
-- NOTE2: before the block was actually visible for the processing system).
-- NOTE2: For completed blocks which still exist, we assume they are all closed, and use b.time_update as the block closure time estimate, because
-- NOTE2: block destinations are not supposed to be marked as complete if the block is still open:
-- NOTE2: in the production instance, there are actually 4 test blocks which were reopened after the transfer was completed, but we include them anyway.
-- NOTE2: For completed blocks which don't exist anymore, for which we only have anonymous latency log entries, we simply have no way to estimate the
-- NOTE2: block closure time - so we just set arbitrarily the block closure time equal to the arrival time of the last file replica
-- NOTE3: suspend_time is historically bugged and can cause negative latencies in special edge cases, but we don't attempt to correct
-- NOTE3: the historical values because we don't have all information available.
