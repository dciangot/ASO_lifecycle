# This file contains the map of DB Roles to Schema-authorisations.
# The schema-authorisations are declared in RoleMap.txt, where they are
# mapped to schema-entities.
#
# AuthMapper.pl takes this file and compares it with the DB roles which
# have been granted access to a given database account and checks that
# no roles have been missed out. This makes sure we correctly specify
# database access rights for all database roles that have been granted
# access to the parent schema.
#
# There is a complication: we grant rights to the *_reader and *_writer
# accounts, but then we attach roles to those accounts, not to the
# parent admin account. This is all taken care of automatically, as if
# by magic...
#
# Syntax:
#
# Admin <name of admin account> <DBParam section name> # only one!
#
# Reader <name of reader account> <DBParam section name>
# 'Reader' may be repeated, one account per line
#
# Role <db role> <cms role>
# 'cms role' may be repeated, comma-separated
#
# all text is case-insensitive, apart from DBParam section names
#

# E.g. here's a table for my private testbed
