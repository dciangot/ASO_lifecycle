##H
##H Simple example to illustrate use of POE to poll a service in priority
##H order without overloading it.
##H
##H Options:
##H 
##H --service=$string	=> name of FTS service to use.
##H   with this option only, it will go off and monitor your jobs on that
##H   service
##H
##H --copyjob=$string	=> name of an fts 'copyjob' file.
##H   i.e. one "$src $dst" pair per line, as many lines as you want. This will
##H   _not_ be submitted as a single job, see the --files_per_job option for
##H   how to control that. This file will simply serve as input.
##H
##H --max_parallel_jobs=$int	=> number of transfer jobs to run in parallel
##H   limit job-submission to this many jobs at a time. Does not take account
##H   of other jobs in the queue, only the ones this script submits.
##H
##H --q_interval=$int	=> queue-polling interval.
##H   i.e. interval in which to check the queue for new jobs.
##H
##H --j_interval=$int	=> job-polling interval.
##H   i.e. interval at which to look at a job in detail, whichever job is
##H   next in the priority queue.
##H
##H --files_per_job=$int	=> number of files to submit in one job.
##H   If there are more files than this in the file-queue, they will be taken
##H   this many at a time, and submitted as a number of jobs.
##H
##H --file_flush_interval=$int	=> interval before flushing the file queue
##H   If there are less than $files_per_job files in the queue they will be
##H   left there until this interval passes, to give time for more files to
##H   be added. This allows an external method to put more files in the queue.
##H
##H --file_poll_interval=$int	=> interval at which to look for new files
##H   Every so-many seconds, the file-queue is checked to see if there are
##H   enough files to make it worth submitting a job.
##H
##H --job_trace_dir=$string	=> directory for per-job trace files
##H   Every job has detailed logging which is written to STDOUT by default.
##H   If --job_trace_dir is given, per-job logging will be written to that
##H   directory instead, one file per job, with the job-ID in the name.
##H
##H --file_trace_dir=$string	=> directory for per-file trace files
##H   Every file has detailed logging which is written to the job logfile by
##H   default. If --file_trace_dir is given, per-file logging will be written
##H   to that directory instead, one logfile per file, with the logfile name
##H   based on the destination URL.
##H
##H --help		=> this!
##H --verbose		=> passed to the Glite component...
##H --debug		=> passed to the Glite component...
