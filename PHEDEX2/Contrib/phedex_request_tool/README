phedex_request_tool is a tool to automate phedex request approval
at T1_DE_KIT, using a set of rules to give advice to data managers
whether to approve the request or not.

--- General information

The phedex requests which need to be processes can be queried
from phedex (--query) or read from the command line
(using multiple --request options). 
For each request, the script retrieves the phedex information about
the request and the datasets specified in it.
The default instance / site for which queries are performed is
the production instance of T1_DE_KIT, but other sites (--site)
and instances (--instance) can be specified as well.

By default, phedex_request_tool just displays detailed information
about the request. With --commit, it is possible to either
ask the user on the command line wether to approve the request
or perform the approval automatically (--auto), based on the
recommendation given by a set of rules.

In order to approve phedex requests, a valid grid proxy / certificate
is necessary. By default, the path to file is taken from the
environment variable X509_USER_PROXY. However it can also be specified
by hand (--proxy) if needed.

--- Details

In the implementation provided here, the whole tape family checking
logic is always skipped (in the function collect_tape_family_infos),
since this is assumed to be highly specific to each site.

The rules operating on the request are defined in the function
(check_request), and can be adapted to the needs of each site.
The common use case of approving all 'GEN' datasets is already
implemented.

Packaged with this script is a subset of libraries (toolKIT) used
by T1_DE_KIT for various site admin tasks. For the basic running
of the script only the following files are really needed:
  toolKIT/phedex.py, toolKIT/utils.py and toolKIT/webservice_api.py
