DBS MIGRATION README

This describes briefly the programs used in the DBS2 Migration:


DBSMappingFill

Fills mapping tables in TMDB for dataset renaming and block renaming
(t_migration_dataset_map and t_migration_block_map respectively).
Takes a MIGRATION_FILE as input.  Connects to DBS2 and looks up every
file associated with the "new" dataset path in MIGRATION_FILE and
looks for it in TMDB's XT_ tables, and makes the associated dataset
and block name maps.

DBSReplicaSync
DBSPostReplicaSync

Updates DBS2 with replica information for every new dataset name in
the MIGRATION_FILE.  DBSReplicaSync uses the XT_ tables for replicas
and DBSPostReplicaSync uses the T_ (migrated) tables.

MigrationFile.txt

The file of datasets to be migrated.  Contains a mapping of old names
to new names.  The old name column is not really used by these
programs anymore, because it could not be relied upon to create
mappings.  Nevertheless this is the official list.

MigrationXcheck.sql

So far a useless SQL with good intentions.

OracleCreateMigrationMaps.sql

Creates the t_migration_dataset_map and t_migration_block_map tables.

phedex.py

The Phedex API for this migration.  Very minimal functionality.

TMDBMigrationStats
TMDBPostMigrationStats

Performs a consistency check of DBS2 vs. TMDB.  Optionally lists file
differences and replica differences.  TMDBMigrationStats uses the XT_
tables of TMDB while TMDBPostMigrationStats uses the T_ tables.  Uses
the MIGRATION_FILE to determine what datasets (new name) to look for.

TMDBSelectiveMigration

Moves data in TMDB from the XT_ tables to the T_ tables.  'copy-as-is'
mode can be used for moving data without renaming it, while
'copy-rename' mode uses the t_migration_*_map tables to rename data as
it is copied over.  Use DBSMappingFill before using 'copy-rename'
mode.
