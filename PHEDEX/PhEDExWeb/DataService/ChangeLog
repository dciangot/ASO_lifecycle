* Changes for 2.0.x

 Now following the convention that this ChangeLog tracks only the first two
 digits of the version number, allowing the last one to cycle freely with
 bugfixes and trivial changes that need not be documented.

 Bug fixes
  * updateSubscription: SUSPEND_UNTIL is allowed to be NULL, so check for its
    existence, not its value
  * inject: handle duplicated files properly
    - as long as there is one duplicated file, the whole injection fails.

 New APIs:
 * 'updaterequests': approve or disapprove a request

* Changes for 1.6.6 (1.6.4 and 1.6.5 were never released)

 New APIs:

  * 'delete': delete data!
  * 'blockreplicacompare': compare block replicas at two nodes and output either the differences or the matches
  * 'updatesubscription': change user_group, priority and/or time_suspend of a subscription

 Changes for APIs:

  * 'data':
    - new argument "level", which could be either "file" (default) or "block"
    - when level = "block", no file level details will be shown
  * 'blockreplicas':
    - when none of "block", "dataset" or "node" is set, create_since is default to be 24 hours ago
  * 'filereplicas':
    - internal change that does not affect its functionality nor output
    - use subquery instead of full joint for block name match to improve query efficiency
  * 'subscriptions':
    - works with PHEDEX 4.0 schema
    - has new "collapse" option to control the output in expanded (collapse = 'n') or collapsed (collapse = 'y') views
  * 'tcf':
    - All empty fields have been removed from output.
  * 'transferrequests':
    - Output of request has a new attribute: time_start

 Bug fixes:
  * 'shift/queued' now aggregates correctly
  * documentation links work for sub-pages
  * notification email from subscribe contains wrong comment
  * PHEDEX::Core::Timing::str2time() now accepts YYYYMMDDZhhmm[ss] format

 Changes for the Dataservice:
  * set cache-control header for static content
  * service-path no longer a configurable, instead calculate it from the apache-request object
  * data-service version number now included in the online documentation

 New APIs:

  * 'loadteststreams': display LoadTest streams and their parameters

 Changes for APIs:

  * 'links':
    - now 'distance' is in output

 Bug fix:

  * 'filereplicas':
    - bug fix for mis-landling negation
    - the bug is in PHEDEX::Web::Util::validate_params()

* Changes for 1.6.3pre1

 Changes for the DataService:
  * parameter-validation now correctly handles negation of arguments. This fixes
  savannah bug #68355
  * warnings now issue a stack-trace if 'trap-warnings' is set to 1 in the
  configuration file, which it now is by default.

 Changes for APIs
 * Shift/RequestedQueued now returns only failing nodes by default. Structure
 of returned data changed slightly.
 * Bounce can now issue WARNings as well as die-ing on demand, specify warn=1
 to trigger this.

* Changes for 1.6.2

 Changes for the DataService:
  * failure to send out emails is no longer considered an error. Such failures will be silently ignored, with no indication given to the user

 Changes for APIs:

  * 'transferqueuefiles':
    - rewritten for more efficient query
    - use spooling to limit memory usage
    - total bytes and total number of files, in a block of the same priority/state category, are shown as block attributes
  * 'transferqueueblocks':
    - rewritten for more efficient query
  * 'inject':
   - enforce 'verbose=0', to prevent debug printout causing the returned data to be invalid XML. (This note was added after the release, oops!)
 
 Bug fix:

    - fixed a bug related to mis-calculated priority
  * 'subscriptions':

    ignored.

* Changes for 1.5.1

  * Bug fix for all APIs: Empty arguments 'e.g. api?name=' are removed

    generate a large request (all possible data) when some argement
    should have been required.

* Changes for 1.5.0

 New APIs:

  * routerhistory - history of router activity and input parameters
  * nodeusagehistory - history of space usage at a node
  * links - existing transfer links and their state
  * missingfiles - which files are missing from a block
  * subscriptions - existing subscriptions and their parameters
  * time value now accepts ISO8601 interval format: P[nY][nM][nD][T[nH][nM][nS]] 

 Changes for APIs:

  * blockreplicas, filereplicas - now return blocks which have zero
    file replicas, but are subscribed.  Useful for calculating data
    remaining to be transferred.

 Bug Fixes for APIs:

  * fix URI case for logical operatior toggle (op:$name=and,
    op:$name=or).  Now $name is specified in lowercase.

* Changes for 1.4.2

 Bug Fixes for APIs:

  * lfn2pfn, nodes - fix bug where 'node=' option was ignored,
    returning all results

  * linktasks API removed, use transferqueuestats instead.

 General changes:

  * Serve an <error> if client certificate is not found in SiteDB,
    instead of serving an HTML sign-up web page.
  * Fix growing /doc path when browsing documentation.
  * Correctly encode unsafe XML characters.

The data service was born out of a need to integrate with other CMS
services.  The primary APIs were blockreplicas, for turning PhEDEx
into the Data Location Service (DLS), and inect, subscribe, which were
used for automating these actions for the Tier-0.

Original APIs:

  auth			check authentication
  blockreplicas		finds blocks at nodes
  bounce		echos arguments; for testing
  filereplicas		finds files at nodes
  inject		inject data to TMDB from an XML file
  lfn2pfn		convert LFNs to PFNs from TFC in TMDB
  linktasks		task status summary
  nodes			list nodes
  subscribe		make and approve a transfer request from an XML file
  tfc			show the TFC used by a node
