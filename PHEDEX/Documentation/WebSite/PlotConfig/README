This is the configuration area for the GraphTool

GraphTool is packaged with WEBTOOLS, and can be installed from the CMS
RPM repository.

The configuration is quite complex, see start-graphs.sh to get an idea
of what libraries are required.

Below is a description of the PhEDEx-specific tool configuration
directories:

conf/     contains configuration XML for initializing the GraphTool
src/      contains custom code for generating PhEDEx graphs
tools/    contains small startup scripts for starting the GraphTool server
