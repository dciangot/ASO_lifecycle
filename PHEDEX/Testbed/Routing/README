This is a first attempt at exploring what we need from a test harness. In this
directory are contained a number of tests (e.g. SimpleTwoNode) that will test
the behaviour of elements of the PhEDEx routing system.

At present (first iteration) there a number of files in each test directory:

prep.sql
clean.sql
idealtable.txt
TheTest
Config

The first two are used to prep and clean the TMDB before and after the test. The
third contains the output we expect from a query on the TMDB that is run during
the test. The fourth is a test executable. The last is a standardd Config 
file that is used to actually run the agents for the test.

In addition, there needs to be an env.sh script in the Routing directory; an
example from RAL is included here.
The agents and run also need to access a DBparam file to connect to the TMDB.

To run one of the tests:

. env.sh
./RunTest -db <your DBparam file> -test <a test directory>
