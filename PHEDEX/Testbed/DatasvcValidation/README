This is a quick brain dump ...

[acceptance test]
accept_test.pl          acceptance test script, driven by accept.test
accept.test             test commands for acceptance test

Usage: accept_test.pl [--verbose] [--webserver <web_host>] [--debug] [--file <test_file>]

--verbose               verbose mode
--help                  show this information
--webserver <web_host>  host name with optional port number such as
                        "cmswttest.cern.ch:7001"
                        default to be: "cmswttest.cern.ch"
--file <file>           file that contains test command
                        without --file, the commands are read from stdin

The command format is exactly the same as if the command is issued in
the URL without the prefix.
Need to take care of URL special characters, such as '#' (%23)
A '-' in front of the command line expects a negative result.
'#' in the first character specify a comment. All comments are simply
printed out.
"accept.test" is the documentation and example.

[performance test]
perf_test.pl            main program that launch the test
ptest.pl                test driver that is installed on every test host
                        it should be in the command path and is invoked
                        by "ssh ..." inside perf_test.pl
test_hosts              a list of test hosts, one per line
check_test_hosts.sh     check if all test host are ready

* the test hosts need to be "prepared" before the test:
  the user who is running the test should be able to ssh into the
  test host from the head node. ptest.pl should be already in the
  command path so that it can be invoked through ssh.

usage: perf_test.pl <options>

where <options> are:

--verbose               verbose mode
--help                  show this infromation
--webserver <web_host>  host name with optional port such as
                        "cmswttest.cern.ch:7001"
                        default is "cmswttest.cern.ch"
--data-type             how to interpreter positional 
                        it could be "node" or "link"
                        when being "node", positional  are
                        interpretered as list of nodes
                        when being "link", positional  are
                        interpretered as list of pairs of links
--test-host-file <file> the file that contains a list of test hosts
                        one host per line
--count                 number of test instances at the same time
--cmd                   test command, such as "agent?node=T1_US_FNAL_MSS"
--port                  port to communicate with test hosts
                        default is 12345

In the command line, [NODE], [FROM], [TO] will be substituted by
real values from the database.

Example:

# check if all test hosts are ready
check_test_hosts.sh test_hosts

# lunch 8 instance of 'transferqueueblocks?from=[FROM]&to=[TO]'
# [FROM] and [TO] will be substituted at run time with values from the
# database

perf_test.pl --count 8 --test-host-file test_hosts --cmd 'transferqueueblocks?from=[FROM]&to=[TO]'
