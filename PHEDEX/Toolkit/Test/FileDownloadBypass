##H Check whether to bypass the file download.
##H
##H Usage: FileDownloadBypass [-t] FROM-PFN TO-PFN
##H
##H This is used by the file download agent to determine whether we
##H can safely bypass the file transfer and proceed to publish the
##H file.  This happens when the TV_LCG_Production virtual node has
##H files registered for my site, but we don't know about them yet.
##H
##H If the file copy is safe to bypass, print out the destination
##H PFN to use instead.  Typically this is the source file, though
##H one could use something else as well.
##H
##H To proceed with normal copy, print out nothing.  The exit code
##H from this script is ignored.
##H
##H If "-t" option is given, goes into test mode, passing random
##H files through.
